# FinSight - VPBank Technology Hackathon 2025
This is a project of Group 278 for the "VPBank Technology Hackathon 2025" of Challenge #20: Semantic Chunking for Multiformat Documents
> **Challenge #20:** Semantic Chunking for Multiformat Documents

## üöÄ About the Project: FinSight

**FinSight** is an intelligent AI platform engineered to tackle the complex challenge of financial analysis across disparate document formats. For financial analysts at VPBank, consolidating critical data from polished PDF reports, supplementary Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, and even scanned images is a massive, time-consuming, and error-prone operational drain.

**FinSight** automates the entire workflow: from ingesting multi-format documents and extracting data to enriching it with AI and providing a powerful query interface. It transforms a messy collection of files into a single, reliable, and instantly queryable source of truth.

### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Multi-Format Handling:** Natively ingests and parses PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PNG, and JPG files, creating a unified data pipeline for all sources.
*   **Automated Financial Analysis:** Allows users to ask for complex financial ratios (e.g., "Calculate the Debt-to-Equity ratio for 2023"), and the system computes the answer from the extracted data.
*   **High-Speed Semantic Search:** Enables searching for qualitative information (e.g., "market risks") across all documents based on meaning, not just keywords.
*   **Event-Driven & Serverless Architecture:** Built on a scalable, resilient, and cost-effective event-driven model powered by AWS, ensuring it's robust enough for enterprise workloads.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

FinSight's architecture is designed based on the principles of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, focusing on asynchronicity, scalability, and the use of purpose-built services for each stage of the data lifecycle.
